Installation:
-------------

Building Devilspie2 requires pkg-config, gtk, wnck and lua libraries. On a
Debian system, installing the following packages should do it:

pkg-config
libglib2.0-dev
liblua5.3-0-dev
libwnck-3-dev
libgtk-3-dev
gettext
libxrandr-dev (optional)

On a system still using Gtk version 2, replace the wnck and gtk libs with:

libwnck-dev
libgtk2.0-dev


To build, you simply do a

	make

(which will build with Gtk3 libs) or

	make GTK2=on

to make the build use the Gtk2 libs.

You can use other versions of Lua. For example:

	make LUA=lua5.1
	make LUA=lua5.4

You can build without xrandr:

	make NO_XRANDR=yes

This will in the end create the devilspie2 binary in the bin/ folder.
To build the same executable with debugging enabled, run

	make DEBUG=1

Note that this may not do a full build – if you've been compiling without
DEBUG=1, you should run “make clean” first..

(Any value works for GTK2, NO_XRANDR and DEBUG; it only matters whether
they're defined.)


To install Devilspie2 system-wide, run make install as superuser:

	su -c "make install"

or on systems using sudo:

	sudo make install

This will default to /usr/local, installing the binary to /usr/local/bin -
this can be changed using PREFIX variable, and need to applied all through
the build system.

	make PREFIX=/usr
	sudo make PREFIX=/usr install
